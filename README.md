# MushroomMap

This is a simple interactive map I made using Scalable Vector Graphics.
A benefit of using SVGs in websites is that they do not lose resolution when scaling and thus add a very sleek look to the website.
They also can be embedded directly into HTML code and are much smaller than needing an image that has a set amount of pixels.
This can be opened in any browser. When the mouse hovers over a region, the zone title shows up by the cursor.
